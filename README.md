# Retail-Product-Data-Analysis-on-Zepto-Dataset
Retail product sales analysis on Zepto dataset using Python. Explored pricing, discounts, stock availability, and revenue potential. Identified pricing anomalies, product weight distributions, and top revenue categories. Visualized insights to support data-driven retail decisions and strategy
Key analysis questions tackled include:

Dataset overview: total rows, unique product categories, and product samples.

Product pricing: maximum, minimum MRP, average discount percentages, and discount distribution.

Inventory insights: stock availability, products out of stock, and quantity distribution across categories.

Product features: average weight by category, identifying heaviest and lightest categories.

Data quality checks: identifying cases where discounted selling price exceeds MRP indicating possible errors.

Pricing dynamics: top and bottom products by discounted price, category-wise average selling prices.

Revenue potential: computed category-wise revenue potential based on MRP and available quantity.

Distribution assessments: product distribution across various weight ranges and pricing brackets.

Performance summaries: ratio of in-stock to out-of-stock items and total revenue loss from discounts.

This project demonstrates practical application of Python's data analysis libraries including pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization, providing actionable insights for retail pricing, stock management, and strategic decision-making.
